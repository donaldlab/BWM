This repository contains code from the following publication: Jou JD, Jain S, Georgiev I, Donald BR. 
BWM*: A novel, provable ensemble- based dynamic programming algorithm for sparse approximations of 
computational protein design.  We recommend that this be used to test the hypothesis 
and results of protein design with sparse residue interaction graphs as presented in this manuscript.
For new empirical designs, we recommend using the latest version of OSPREY 2.1 
available at http://www.cs.duke.edu/donaldlab/osprey.php that includes continuous sidechain and backbone 
flexibility, ensemble-based design, and new and faster methods to calculate energy functions. 

All the results on the 136 protein design problems and 6 retrospective protein design problems discussed 
in this manuscript are available online at 
http://www.cs.duke.edu/donaldlab/Supplementary/jcb15/bwmstar/


The runs here are initial experiments to determine for what setups using doBranchDGMEC is most powerful. These runs should not be used for exact run time comparison; rather, these runs should be used to get a general idea of the computational bottlenecks and power of doBranchDGMEC and the related functions.

All runs were performed on hexa.cs.duke.edu, which has 8 Dual Core AMD Opteron(tm) Processor 885 at 2613.712MHz, a total of 64GB RAM.

For a given system, the runs are peformed using the following steps (the example is given with 1amu):

(DEE)
java -Xmx1024M KStar doDEE System.cfg DEE.cfg >! logDEE1amu.cfg


(GBD)
java -Xmx1024M KStar doDEE System.cfg DEEgg.cfg >! logGG1amu.cfg
cd BranchDecomposition
java -Xmx1024M -classpath .:jmatharray.jar BranchDecomposition ../gd_1amu ../gd_1amu_bd >! logBD1amu.out
		gd_1amu_bd - will contain the branch Decomposition.
cd ..
java -Xmx1024M KStar doBranchDGMEC System.cfg GD.cfg >! logGD1amu.out


For the doBranchDGMEC run, -Xmx may have to be increased significantly in some cases (e.g., 10000M-30000M).


Additional commands:

doBranchDGMEC 
genSparseGraph
prunedObjInfo - if DEE pruning objects have been computed previously, set to TRUE. Defaults to FALSE.
